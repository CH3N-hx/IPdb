example: Input: Microsoft: Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge web browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers.” Output: {”categories”: ["Software", "Technological Hardware"]}. In the description, Microsoft serves system and professional software products not classified into other categories, such as operating systems, productivity applications and browser, so it can be classified into “Software” category.  It also mentions hardware products like personal computers, video game consoles, which falls into “Electronic Components & Equipment” category.So, the categories are ["Software", "technological hardware"]. For the rest of the categories, the organization is not likely to be classified in. It is not sure whether it can be categorized into "Defense Manufacturer" category based on the description, so it is not presented in the output.

example: Input: General Dynamics: General Dynamics Corporation GD is an American publicly traded aerospace and defense corporation headquartered in Reston Virginia As of it was the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world by arms sales and fifth largest in the United States by total sales. Output: {”categories”: ["Machinery", "Defense Manufacturer"]}. The description matches the "Machinery" category as it mentions aerospace trading. And as it mentions “defense”, “defense contractor”, and “arms sales”, it is also likely to be in "Defense Manufacturer" category.

example: Input: Comcast: Comcast Corporation is the largest American multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate. The corporation is the second-largest broadcasting and cable television company in the world by revenue (behind AT&T), and is also the largest pay-TV company, the largest cable TV company, and largest home Internet service provider in the United States.Output: {”categories”: ["ISP", "Media"]}.For the categories, the description matches the"ISP" because it explicitly defines the organization as “Internet service provider” which falls in the "ISP" category. It also mentions broadcasting and pay-TV, so it can be categorized into "Media & Entertainment" category.

example: Input: Avnet, Inc.: Avnet Inc is a distributor of electronic components headquartered in Phoenix Arizona named after Charles Avnet who founded the company. Output:{”categories”: ["Retail & Distribution"]}. it mentions "distributor of electronic components" which should be in "Retail & Distribution" category. So, it is categorized into "Retail & Distribution" category. Although it mentions "electronic components", it is "distributor of electronic components" instead of "manufacturers of electronic components", although its core business revolves around electronic components, it should not be categorized into "technological hardware" category.

example: Input: DTE Energy: DTE Energy (formerly Detroit Edison until 1996) is a Detroit-based diversified energy company involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses and services in the United States and Canada. Its operating units include an electric utility serving 2.2 million customers and a natural gas utility serving 1.3 million customers in Michigan.  Output: {”categories”: ["Utilities"]}.
